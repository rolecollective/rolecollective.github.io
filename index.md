Reframing Our Language Experience (ROLE): A consortium of scholars working against essentialist notions of language in policy and practice, within academia and beyond

This cross-institutional transdisciplinary group seeks to work towards concrete policy changes in research by (a) bringing together evidence that taking essentialist approaches to language enacts harm, (b) supporting each other to advocate for and implement policy changes across institutional and disciplinary spaces, and (c) demonstrating scholarly consensus within linguistics and language research.

We want to work towards changing assumptions about language and identity by changing how these assumptions are encoded in institutional policies and practices.

Following (Rickford & King, Charity Hudley et al, etc), we seek to focus our scholarly energies on enacting changes in the spaces where we have influence, and expanding our reach. Inspired by the cross-institutional approach of ManyBabies, we find strength in collaboration, and know that a multi-pronged approach is necessary to enact structural and cultural change. Along with producing works which can be categorized as scholarly in a traditional manner, this group seeks to create persuasive policy writings and support collaborators who are trying to make change in their own disciplinary and institutional spaces.

The ROLE collective was established by [Dr. Savithry Namboodiripad] (http://savi.ling.lsa.umich.edu/) and [Dr. Ethan Kutlu] (https://ethankutlu.com) in 2022.
